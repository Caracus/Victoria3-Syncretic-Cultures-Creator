Short Desc:
Enables syncretic cultures to develop organically and gradually by merging together cultures selected by the player over the duration of a playthrough.

Long Desc:
Enables syncretic cultures to develop organically and gradually by merging together cultures selected by the player over the duration of a playthrough.



How it works:
Enables syncretic cultures to develop organically and gradually by merging together cultures selected by the player over the duration of a playthrough.



How it works:
    Choose which syncretic culture you want to see! Cultures you dont like/agree with wont appear.
    Select opt-in cultures! Dont like Swiss merging with a syncretic German for example? Just select no in the pop-up.
    Once you unlock pan-nationalism a journal entry will start ticking.
    Every state that matches the base and optional cultures will be designated as a homeland of your syncretic culture.
    Each year an event will run in the background that converts a dynamic amount of eligible pops to the syncretic culture.
    The percentage of this conversion is based on literacy, discrimination, unlocked techs and importantly the pop type. (See table below for information in detail)
    After 30, 50 and 70 years an event will fire with 3 options:
    	Nothing changes
    	Remove your old primary cultures.
    	Remove the homelands of your old primary within your country and the primary cultures from your country.
    Regardless of your previous [b]choice[/b] the yearly conversion tick will continue for the [b]entire[/b] duration of the game. You can speed it up or keep it rather immersive with your choice.


Compatibility:
This mod is highly compatible as all files are standalone and dont override anything. As long as the cultures targeted by this mod exist in vanilla it will work.
